This is a simple HTML/Javascript game created for the Touhou ⑨ Jam, as a celebration of Cirno Day 2019 (2019/09/09). It can be played at <https://karob.itch.io/flash-freeze>.

Cirno bullied the frogs for too long and ran out of magic power. Now she needs to collect magic stars so she can fight back before they corner her! Freeze 25 frogs to show them who's strongest in Gensokyo.

- Arrow keys or ESDF to move.
- Spacebar to freeze nearby enemies after collecting a magic star.
- R to restart.
